<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hygienic Point Level Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hygienic point level sensor market has two main types: contact type and non-contact type. </p><p>The contact type sensors physically come into contact with the substance they are monitoring. They use a probe or a float that interacts with the substance to determine its level. These sensors are commonly used in tanks and storage vessels where direct measurement is required.</p><p>On the other hand, non-contact type sensors do not touch the substance. They use technologies like ultrasonic, laser, or radar to measure the distance or level of the substance without any physical contact. These sensors are suitable for applications where hygiene and contamination control are crucial, such as the food and pharmaceutical industries.</p></p>
