<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Reflective Glass Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electron Beam Evaporation</li><li>Sputtering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Anti-Reflective Glass Coatings market has two major types: Electron Beam Evaporation and Sputtering. Electron Beam Evaporation involves evaporating the coating material inside a vacuum chamber, which then condenses onto the glass surface. This process is known for its high deposition rate and excellent coating uniformity. On the other hand, Sputtering uses plasma to eject atoms from the coating material, which are then deposited onto the glass surface. Sputtering is preferred for its versatility, allowing different materials to be used and offering better control over the coating thickness.</p></p>
