<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photomask Inspection System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Die to Die (DD) Method</li><li>Die to Database (DB) Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Photomask Inspection System market comprises two main types: Die to Die (DD) and Die to Database (DB) methods. The DD method involves comparing multiple dies on a single photomask to ensure consistency and quality across the entire mask. In contrast, the DB method compares the photomask against a predefined database of patterns to identify any deviations or errors. Both methods play an essential role in ensuring accurate and reliable photomask manufacturing, but they differ in the approach used to inspect the masks.</p></p>
