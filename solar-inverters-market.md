<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Inverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Model</li><li>Integrated Model</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Solar inverters are devices that convert the direct current (DC) generated by solar panels into alternating current (AC) electricity that can be used by households or fed into the grid. There are two main types of solar inverters in the market: independent models and integrated models. Independent models are stand-alone inverters that are connected to the solar panels separately. Integrated models, on the other hand, have the inverter integrated within the solar panels. Both types serve the same purpose of converting DC to AC but differ in their physical setup and installation process.</p></p>
